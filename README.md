# Two Dice Statistic

- If I roll 2 dices at the same time for a lot of times and ask you which total made from the 2 dices has the highest probability in the long term. ***What would your answer be?***
- My friend, Jun, and I made this website [Two Dice Statistic](https://two-dice-statistic.vercel.app/) to simulate the situation and answer this question.
